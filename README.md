# Tag It!

Tag emails, files, folders & web pages for easy access later on.

I created this workflow to keep related items together for certain activities — all in one place. Projects, research, orders, favorites, recipes... whatever. I mainly use this for short term stuff. Less so for long-term bookmarks. I can tag, find & open email, files, folders & webpages in a breeze. 

To summarize... a consolidated Alfred system to:  

✓  Keep your projects organized  
✓  Keep your work moving forward  
✓  Keep your brain sane

Works with: Apple Mail ∙ Apple Finder ∙ Chrome-based browsers
